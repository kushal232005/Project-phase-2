Objective: The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts Air Quality Index (AQI) levels by leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. By analyzing historical air quality data alongside meteorological and environmental factors, the model aims to provide timely and precise air quality predictions. This can aid policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public in making informed decisions to mitigate pollution and protect public health. Data Sources: To build a robust predictive model, the following data sources are considered:

Air Quality Data: Historical records of pollutant concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃.

Meteorological Data: Information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation.

Geospatial and Temporal Data: Location coordinates, elevation, and time stamps to capture spatial and temporal variations.

Satellite Imagery: Data from satellites like Sentinel-5P to enhance spatial coverage and provide additional environmental insights. arXiv

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Aggregate data from reliable sources such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), meteorological departments, and satellite databases.

Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency.

Engineer features that may influence air quality, such as traffic density, industrial activity, and vegetation cover.

Model Selection and Training:

Evaluate various ML algorithms, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

Implement time-series models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the data.

Train models using historical data and validate their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Model Evaluation and Optimization:

Compare model performances and select the best-performing model based on validation results.

Fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Deployment and Monitoring:

Develop a user-friendly interface or dashboard to display real-time AQI predictions.

Set up automated data pipelines for continuous model updates and predictions.

Monitor model performance over time and retrain as necessary to maintain accuracy.
